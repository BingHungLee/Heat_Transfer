        "* Pumps are used to circulate the feed through the reboiler.\n",
        "* Higher circulation rates can be maintained so that the fouling is low\n",
        "* The boiling may occur either inside or outside the tubes.\n",
        "* It is preferred for fouling services,viscious liquids, liquids containing suspend solids, and low pressure systems (These are also used with viscious and solid-bearing liquids.)\n",

        "## Pro\n",
        "1. Viscous fluid can be used (anti-fouling is better than natural circulation)\n",
        "2. Liquids with suspended particles can be used.\n",
        "3. Circulation can be controlled\n",
        "4. Higher heat transfer coefficient  ( better than natural circulation\n",

        "## Con\n",
        "1. pump and its operation add to the total cost."
