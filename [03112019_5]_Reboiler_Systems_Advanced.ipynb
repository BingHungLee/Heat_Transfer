        "  *  These relate to the fact that the pressure drop, both for the liquid and the vapor, has to be the same in a system.\n",
        "  * Since the vapor density is very low compared to the liquid density, the vapor velocity has to be very high to obtain the same pressure drop as for the liquid stream.\n",
        "  * This results in a shear exerted by the vapor on the liquid surfacem which accelerates the liquid layer. The pressure drop associated with it is caleed the acceleration losses.\n",

        "* Condition 2 : Wavy and slug flow patterns in the two-phase flow regimes are inherently unstable and should be avoided.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Condition 3 :  Changes in the inlet flow rates , compositions, etc make a system departure from its current steady operation and try to seek another steady state.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Condition 4 : If the circulatino rate is low, the boil-off of the available volatile components will result in an increase in the boiling temperature of the remaininig liquid, thus reducing the vaporization rate. Some liquid from the trays will be dumped on the base, which will replenish the volatile components in the circulating stream, and the rate of vaporization will increase until the volatile components decrease again. thus,surges in the vaporization rate will occur periodically resulting in an unsteady operation."
